## Differences with Ethereum mainnet

### [EIP-4788](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4788)

The ring buffer data-structure is sized to expose roots at most `8191 * SECONDS_PER_SLOT` seconds old. The value of `8191` is chosen to approximate ~1 day of seconds (assuming `SECONDS_PER_SLOT` = 12), and should be a prime number (see section 6.2 of [ChainSecurity audit](https://chainsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChainSecurity_Ethereum_Foundation_EIP-4788_Contract_Audit.pdf) for reasoning). Gnosis chain has a lower `SECONDS_PER_SLOT` value of 5. The contract logic will works exactly as expected but it will only allow to retrieve roots that are at most 0.47 days old.

| Constant | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| HISTORICAL_ROOTS_MODULUS | 8191 |
| BEACON_ROOTS_ADDRESS | TBD |

### [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844)

Gnosis chain has slots significantly faster than Ethereum. Bigger blocks _could_ have a higher cost to the network than Ethereum so we may price blobs differently. Ethereum mainnet has chosen a target of 3 blobs from real live experiments on mainnet with big blocks. Consecuently this parameters may not be adecuate.

Gnosis chain has significantly cheaper fees than mainnet, so blob spam is a concern. Ethereum's `MIN_BLOB_GASPRICE` makes blob space free (1e-18 USD / blob) if usage is under the target for a sustained period of time. The same concern applies to Ethereum, but consensus is that choosing a specific value that may apply to only some market conditions and not others. Gnosis however has chosen a min gas price of 1 GWei, so a similar decision can be made here. 

| Constant | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| MIN_BLOB_GASPRICE | TBD |
| TARGET_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK | TBD |
| MAX_BLOB_GAS_PER_BLOCK | TBD |

### [EIP-7514](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7514)

Gnosis chain has a custom `CHURN_LIMIT_QUOTIENT` config value, thus it should use a custom max churn limit.

| Constant | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| MAX_PER_EPOCH_CHURN_LIMIT | TBD |
